# Strategic Implementation of Robust Information Technology Security Policies for Higher Education

This repository presents the MSc dissertation research project by **Harihara Sudhan Shanmugam**, completed at **Buckinghamshire New University** under the MSc Cyber Security programme.

The research investigates the strategic design, implementation, and governance of robust information security policies within the higher education sector. It addresses both technical and managerial layers, identifying barriers to effective enforcement and proposing a structured framework for resilient policy application in academic institutions.

## 📌 Summary

The project focuses on:

- The need for Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs) and clear governance structures in academic institutions  
- Alignment of policy with international standards such as ISO 27001 and GDPR  
- Risk mitigation strategies involving SIEM, SOAR, MFA, endpoint security, and access controls  
- The gap between policy documentation and practical enforcement in higher education environments  
- A proposed **“View of Reference”** framework to support holistic policy enforcement and cross-departmental accountability  
- The common conflation of **cybersecurity governance with general IT operations**, highlighting the structural and cultural need to distinguish security leadership from traditional IT service delivery models

The research includes a comparative case study involving **Buckinghamshire New University** and **University of Exeter**, supported by expert interviews, institutional document analysis, and a policy evaluation matrix.
