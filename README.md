## 📌 Summary

The project focuses on:

- The need for Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs) and clear governance structures in academic institutions  
- Alignment of policy with international standards such as ISO 27001 and GDPR  
- Risk mitigation strategies involving SIEM, SOAR, MFA, endpoint security, and access controls  
- The gap between policy documentation and practical enforcement in higher education environments  
- A proposed **“View of Reference”** framework to support holistic policy enforcement and cross-departmental accountability  
- The common conflation of **cybersecurity governance with general IT operations**, highlighting the structural and cultural need to distinguish security leadership from traditional IT service delivery models

The research includes a comparative case study involving **Buckinghamshire New University** and **University of Exeter**, supported by expert interviews, institutional document analysis, and a policy evaluation matrix.
